If none of the solutions below work for you, please get in touch with us for more help. If you get in touch, weâll ask you for a few different things to help us diagnose your issue and find a solution.

Note: If youâre experiencing issues with the Mac app being slow, there are a few other solutions to try, you can find more details in our Why is the Mac app slow? article.

1. Check your plugins

Sometimes an incompatible or outdated plugin may be causing the Mac app to crash. So, itâs a good idea to try using the Mac app without any plugins running, to see if that could be causing your problem.

To disable your plugins temporarily, quit the Mac app and then launch it again while holding down the Shift key â§.  This opens the Mac app in Safe Mode and if everything works as expected, a plugin may have been causing the crash.

To find out which plugin(s) are the cause of your problem, close the Mac app and launch without holding â§ to enable plugins again. Choose Sketch âº Preferences âº Plugins and disable or uninstall all of them. Then add them back one by one until you find which plugin is causing you issues.

Note: Some plugins, like Craft, will still be loaded even when you disable them, so uninstalling is the only way to make sure theyâre not interfering with the Mac app.

If a plugin is crashing Sketch on launch, you can uninstall all of them by moving the Plugins folder to your Desktop:


  Quit the Mac app
  Open Finder
  Select Go âº Go to Folderâ¦ (ââ§G)
  Enter the following path in the dialog that appears: ~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3 and click Go
  Drag the Plugins folder to your Desktop and relaunch Sketch


Now you can proceed to install your plugins one by one, until you find the one thatâs causing the crash.

Plugins are created by third-party developers, so youâd need to get in touch with them for further support and assistance. But before you do, try checking to see if thereâs an update available for the plugin thatâs causing you issues. That can often solve things.

If disabling your plugins doesnât help, move on to the next suggestion.

2. Restart your Mac

We know this sounds a lot like âHave you tried turning it off and on again?â, but sometimes a simple restart can be a fool-proof way to fix a problem in Sketch.

If possible, save your work, then quit the Mac app and restart your Mac. If a full reboot doesnât resolve your issue, try the next solution.

3. Remove corrupted preference files

The Mac app stores your preferences in a file, and sometimes this file can get corrupted with bad data. Removing this file forces the Mac app to create a fresh preferences file that wonât cause the same issues.

Donât worry, we wonât delete the file completely â weâll just move the file out of the way, so we can restore it later if needed. Follow these steps to remove the file and have Sketch create a new one.


  Close the Mac app
  Open Finder
  Select Go âº Go to Folderâ¦ (ââ§G)
  Enter the following path in the dialog that appears: ~/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3.plist and click Go
  The preferences file will be selected. Drag it to your Desktop and relaunch the Mac app


If everything is now working as expected, you can delete the preferences file from your Desktop.

Note: When you delete the preferences file you may need to set some preferences in the app and plugins again.

If your issue still isnât resolved, you can close the Mac app and drag your original preferences file back to its place (overwriting the new version) to restore your user defaults.

4. Re-install the Mac app

A clean re-install of the Mac app may well fix things if the above steps havenât helped. We recommend you use an uninstaller like AppCleaner (free) to make sure you remove all files related before you install a new copy.

After you have completed uninstalling the Mac app, please re-download the latest version and enter your license key or Sketch Account details again, if prompted. (If you do not have a note of your license key, you can retrieve it over on our License Admin.",

General troubleshooting

Check your plugins

We do our best to check plugins and work directly with plugin developers to prevent issues. But sometimes they can cause issues. To work out if a plugin is at fault, check How do I launch Sketch in Safe Mode?

If you do come across an issue caused by a plugin, check to see if thereâs an update available for it, or get in touch with itâs developer for further support and assistance.

Try a complete reinstall

Sometimes a problem with your current installation of the Mac app can cause issues, especially if itâs an update from a previous version. In this case, itâs worth trying a clean reinstall. To do this:


  Quit the Mac app and open Finder
  Select Go âº Go to Folderâ¦ (ââ§G)
  Enter the following path in the dialog that appears: ~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3 and click Go
  Copy the Plugins and Libraries folders to your Desktop
  Download, install and launch AppCleaner (free)
  Drag the Sketch Application icon from your /Applications folder onto the App Cleaner window
  Click Remove to have AppCleaner remove all files (not Sketch documents) related to Sketch
  Download and install the latest version of the Mac app from www.sketch.com/updates
  Make sure you move the latest version of the Mac app to your Applications folder
  Launch the Mac app and enter your license Information or log in with your Sketch Account details


If you need to, you can now reinstall your Libraries and Plugins by dragging and dropping them onto the relevant pane within the Mac appâs Preferences.

Document-specific troubleshooting

There might also be something in your document itself that is compromising the Mac appâs performance, so we highly recommend checking some of these points:


  If you are adding lots of images to a document, a handy solution to keep its size under control is to use the reduce image size feature.
  Watch out for multiple blurs and shadows, as they require more processing power than regular layers to render them.
  A large number of Artboards all on the same page might not be the best structure in terms of performance. A good practice to follow is to take advantage of Pages and move some Artboards to different pages.
  Be aware of importing highly-detailed vector artwork from elsewhere that might contain an extremely high number of bezier curves and points. A typical example of this might be a world map, or a textured pattern.",

          "text": "Sometimes an incompatible plugin may be causing the Mac app to work unexpectedly or crash. You can use Safe Mode to run the Mac app without plugins and see if thatâs the case.

How to use Safe Mode

To disable your plugins temporarily, quit the Mac app and then launch it again whileÂ holding down the Shift key â§. This opens it in Safe Mode and if everything works as expected, a plugin may have been causing the issue.

To find out which plugin(s) are the cause of your problem, close the Mac app and launch it again without holding down the Shift key to enable your plugins again. ChooseÂ Sketch âº Preferences âº PluginsÂ and disable all of them. Then add them back one by one until you find which plugin is causing you issues.

Please note: Some plugins, like Craft, will still be loaded even when you disable them, so uninstalling is the only way to make sure theyâre not interfering with the Mac app.

How to manually disable plugins

If a plugin is crashing the Mac app on launch, you can uninstall all of them by moving the Plugins folder to your Desktop:

  Drag the Plugins folder to your Desktop and relaunch Sketch


Now you can proceed to install your plugins one by one, until you find the one thatâs causing the crash.

What can I do about plugin issues?

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "If youâre having issues saving files from the Mac app to a location on Google Drive, this might be due to security rules implemented by Apple on the macOS that prevent applications from working with files in certain locations.

To fix this, youâll need to grant the Mac app Full Disk Access under the Security &amp;amp; Privacy pane in System Preferences. Hereâs how to do that:


  From your menu bar, choose ï£¿ &amp;gt; System Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;amp; Privacy, then select the Privacy tab.
  To make changes here, click on the lock icon in the bottom-left corner of the window and enter your username and password (or one for an administrator on your machine) in the prompt that appears.
  In the panel on the left, choose Full Disk Access, then click on the + button under the panel on the right.
  Select Sketch from the list of applications that appears and choose Open, then tick the checkbox next to it.


Following the steps above will allow Sketch to write files to any location on your Mac. But rest assured, we take your privacy and security seriously here and will not abuse this permission.

You should now be able to save files to Google Drive without any trouble, but if you do have further issues, please get in touch.",

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Although Sketch doesnât always require you to be connected to the internet, the Mac app does sometimes need to connect to a network, for example when you register your copy of the app, or when it needs to validate your license.

If the Mac app tries to register/validate your license and canât connect to our server youâll probably see the following message:

âCould not reach the server to validate your license. Please check your connection and try again.â

To register the Mac app, the app needs to be able to connect to the following:




  
    
      
        Host
        Port
      
    
    
      
        api.prod.sketch.com
        443 (https)
      
    
  




If youâre using a firewall, you will need to change your settings to allow traffic to this host. If youâre using a proxy server, you will need to add our domain to your allowlist, as we donât allow re-signing of certificates.

Note:Â The Mac app does not currently support all (authenticated) proxy setups.

If youâre still unable to register after youâve fixed these settings, we recommend disabling all plugins and restarting the Mac app. Some plugins launch a proxy when you open the app and this can sometimes affect our global network settings.

If youâre struggling to register or validate the Mac app, weâre here to help. To allow us to better understand what issue you might be experiencing, itâs important that you send us the information as detailed below:

Note:Â These issues are normally caused by local network issues so if you have an IT team / department, they can also analyze the following information to try and determine why you canât connect to our API server.

Console logs

Console logs can help us identify exactly whatâs happening when you try to register the Mac app. Follow these instructions to compile and send us the logs.


  Launch theÂ ConsoleÂ app (found in Applications &amp;gt; Utilities).
  In the Search field in the Consoleâs toolbar, enterÂ SketchÂ to filter for only Sketch related logs.
  Launch the Mac app and try to register it with the license key in question.
  Once the problem occurs again (in the case of a timeout this can take as long as 30 seconds), return to the Console.
  Select any of the messages listed in the Console window, then press âA to highlight all of the current logs.
  Copy and paste the logs from the Console into a TextEdit file and save it.


Terminal results

There are a couple of Terminal commands that you can use to test your connection to our server and what problems there are that could be causing that connection to fail. Follow these instructions to compile and send us your Terminal results.

This first Terminal command will tell you if you can connect to our api server, what certificate is used and if there is a proxy in between.


  Launch the Terminal app (found in Applications &amp;gt; Utilities).
  Press Command-N to open a new Terminal window.
  Type curl -I -v https://api.prod.sketch.com (or copy and paste it from here) and hit enter.
  Click anywhere in the Terminal window, then press âA to highlight all of the text.
  Copy and paste the text from the Terminal into a TextEdit file and save it.


The next terminal command is a tool provided by Apple that we can use to test the connection using different set of ATS (App transport security) configurations.


  Launch the Terminal.app (found in Applications &amp;gt; Utilities).
  Press Command-N to open a new Terminal window.
  Type nscurl --verbose --ats-diagnostics https://api.prod.sketch.com (or copy and paste it from here) and hit enter.
  Click anywhere in the Terminal window, then press âA to highlight all of the text.
  Copy and paste the text from the Terminal into a TextEdit file and save it.


Finally, fill out our support form and attach these three filesâtwo with terminal results and one with your console logsâto your response. Once we have this information we can determine why you canât connect to our server and try and solve your issue.

Remember, once youâve registered the Mac app you will be able to use the app while offline, but it does need to connect to a network from time to time, in order to update the local license file and ensure your license is still valid. This will require a valid network connection as outlined above.",

We would suggest firstly checking to make sure that you have set at least one of yourÂ ArtboardsÂ as aÂ StartÂ PointÂ (after this, the defaultÂ ArtboardÂ Sketch Preview will display).

You can do this by selecting one of yourÂ Artboards, and then clickingÂ Prototyping âÂ UseÂ ArtboardÂ asÂ StartÂ PointÂ in the menu bar.

After that, you should go to the Prototype section in the web app see that you can play it from there without issue.

Note also that you will be able to select to view your prototype with or without Hotspots enabled, by clicking in the three dots in the top right corner of the prototype:",

          "text": "If your Smart Layout Symbol is not behaving as expected, it might be because you have manually resized it.

Please note that manually resizing a Symbol that has Smart Layout properties will break its smart auto-resizing behavior.

When you have a Symbol that has Smart Layout properties, you are indicating that you want the size of the Symbol to be determined solely by the content within it.

Sketch does not fully support Symbols having both Smart Layout properties and allowing it to beÂ manually resized.

One easy way to determine if the Symbol has been manually resized is to select your Symbolâs instance in the Mac app and check in the Inspector if the Shrink Instance to fit content icon  is present.



Clicking this icon will remove the manual resizing that has been applied to the Symbol and will correctly resize it based on any override content within it.

We do have plans to continually improve the way the Mac app works with Smart Layout in future releases, but for now, you would need to decide if you want your Symbol to be a regular Symbol which you can manually resize, or a Smart Layout Symbol which resizes itself based on its content.

          "text": "Sketch uses theÂ macOS coordinates system, which is measured in points. So, when you work in Sketch, everything is measured in points â this includes text layers.

A single point in Sketch translates to a single physical pixel on anÂ @1xÂ display. When you export layers, you can change the output scale to whatever you want. So if you export using anÂ @2xÂ scale â for high-resolution âretinaâ displays â a single point will be equal to two pixels. If you export using anÂ @3xÂ scale, a single point will equal three pixels, and so on.

If you copy CSS attributes from the the Mac app or from the Inspector panel in the web app, these will be measured inÂ px. CSSÂ pxÂ measurements are not the same as physical pixels (asÂ this article from W3CÂ explains) but you can think of CSSÂ pxmeasurements as the equivalent to points in Sketch.

Points in Sketch are not the same as points (often abbreviated toÂ pt) that are used as a unit of measurement for typography. TheÂ ptÂ unit of measurement is a fixed size (1/72th of an inch), whereas the size of a physical pixel is based on the resolution of a display.",

          "text": "As Sketch has evolved, and weâve improved the way that we handle documents and uploads, weâve replaced local document syncing to what used to be called Sketch Cloud, with incremental uploads to your Sketch Workspace. When you save a document to your Workspace, itâs available everywhere that you use Sketch, and you can always access the latest version âÂ in the Mac app and the web app.

The benefits of Workspaces include:


  Real-time collaboration â Collaborate alongside other people in the Mac app, in real-time. You can join people in your own Workspace, or invite others from outside your Workspace.
  Auto-saving built inÂ â You no longer need to manually save your work â the Mac app automatically saves all your changes to your Workspace, so thereâs no need to worry about losing work.
  Incremental uploads â The Mac app continuously uploads your changes to the server, so thereâs no need to re-process a large document from scratch each time you want to share a version of it.


If you need to work on a Workspace document while you are offline, you can still do this by opening it via File &amp;gt; Open Recent. When you reconnect, the Mac app will sync all of your edits back to your Workspace.

You can use starred updates to denote important updates to other Workspace members, specify which version of a document Workspace Guests will see (great for sharing work with clients), and select a specific version of a Shared Library to act as the primary source for everyone else to use.

And for projects and documents that arenât quite ready to share with the rest of the people in your Workspace, you can use the My Drafts folder. Itâs completely private, making it the perfect place for work-in-progress ideas. And when you want to get some wider feedback, you can either keep the document in My Drafts and invite individuals to view it, or move it to a public Project in your Workspace and share the link with whoever you want.",

Note: Any information you share with us is 100% confidential and weâll delete any files you share with us as soon as weâve finished our investigations.

Creating a screen recording

If you are experiencing something that can be easily replicated, then a screen recording may help aid your description. If a picture can say a thousand words, then imagine how many a video can say!


	
		
	


ââ§5 on macOS Mojave

If youâre running macOS 10.14 Mojave or later, you can quickly and easily take a screen recording by pressing ââ§5. This will reveal controls that allow you to capture a video of your entire screen, a specific window, or a selected portion of the screen. Make sure to click on Options and then click Show Mouse Clicks, as this really helps us diagnose the issue. Additionally, if youâre comfortable doing so, you can also enable recording via your Macâs microphone from the same options menu and talk through your issue as you make your screen recording.

You can find more detailed instructions on Appleâs website.


	
		
	


QuickTime Player

To create a simple recording, open your QuickTime Player app and chooseÂ File âº New Screen RecordingÂ from the menu. Click the red record button, then follow the instructions on screen. To save, chooseÂ File âº ExportÂ and select the quality. Make sure to click the little arrow beside the record button and then click Show Mouse Clicks, as this really helps us diagnose the issue. If youâre using macOS 10.15 Catalina or newer, you can click Options at the bottom of the screen and select Show Mouse Clicks, instead. Additionally, if youâre comfortable doing so, you can also enable recording via your Macâs microphone from the same options menu and talk through your issue as you make your screen recording.

Sending a crash log

Whenever an application on macOS crashes, itâll automatically create aÂ .crashÂ file containing details as to what may have caused the crash. In the rare event of the Mac app crashing, attaching a crash log when contacting support will help us find out what caused the crash, and how we can fix it. Hereâs how you can get hold of that file:


  In the Finder, go to yourÂ ApplicationsÂ folder, thenÂ UtilitiesÂ and launch the app,Â Console.
  Under theÂ User Diagnostic ReportsÂ portion of the sidebar, locate the most recent crash.
  When found, control-click it, and then select Reveal in Finder from the shortcut menu.
  Copy, or drag out the selected file from the Finder window and attach it to your message to us.


Collecting a spindump

If the Mac app becomes slow or unresponsive, running something called a spindump will gather a report that contains all the information weâll need to debug the problem. You can do this by:


  Launching theÂ Activity MonitorÂ app. This can be found in Applicationsâº UtilitiesÂ folder.
  In the list of process names, you should see Sketch. Select it, then in the toolbar click the â¦ ellipsis button (cog button on macOS Catalina and earlier), and choose Run Spindump from the pop-up menu.
  You may have to enter your computerâs password to continue, but a new window will appear thatâll log the output. This may take a little while.
  Once done, click Saveâ¦ in the top-right and send that file to our support team along with your message.


Obtaining Console logs

Depending on the nature of a reproducible bug or glitch, we may ask to see the content of your Console to see what information the Mac app is telling your computer. This information will help our team investigate the issue better. You can grab them by:


  Launching theÂ ConsoleÂ application from theÂ Applications âº UtilitiesÂ folder in Finder.
  Click the Clear Displayâ item in the toolbar. This will make it easier to find what weâre looking for.
  Back in Sketch, try and trigger the issue (or let it happen).
  When triggered, switch back to Console, and type sketch in the filter bar â you should see some messages â these are the ones weâre looking for.
  Select them all, and in the menu, chooseÂ File âº Save a Copy Asâ¦Â and send that document to us as part of your report.


Gathering a system report

We may request to see a summary of information about your Mac to resolve some specific issues. This information can be gathered via the System Information app.


  Choose the Apple (ï£¿) menu item and hold down the Option key to reveal the System Informationâ¦ item.
  When the System Information app appears, choose File âº Save.
  Select a location where you want to save the file, and include it in your message to our support team.


From this system report, we can gather hardware information, such as whether youâre using an iMac or MacBook, macOS version, information about your graphics card, etc.Â The System Information does not contain or reveal any personal data, or information that may be used to identify you.

If you have any concerns relating to privacy or use of data, please read our EULA.

Determining your browser details

If youâre experiencing issues with the web app we might ask what browser youâre using. While answering âSafariâ, or âChromeâ is correct, thatâs only half the story. This handy link will detect the exact details of your browser, such as whether you have JavaScript enabled, or what version of Flash you have installed. Please copy the link at the top of the page and send it to us.

Common requests

In addition to the above tutorials on how to gather various files to include in your report, weâve outlined the steps required to perform actions we often see requested.

Re-installing the Mac app

To do a clean re-install of the Mac app, itâs recommended that you use an uninstaller like AppCleaner (free) to ensure all files related to the Mac app are deleted.

After you have completed uninstalling the Mac app, please re-download the latest version and enter your license key again if prompted. (If you do not have a note of your license key, you can retrieve it over on our License Admin page.

Deleting the revisions folder

In order to free up some disk space that may have been used by the Mac app and the systemâs Auto Save feature, we suggest using OnyX (free) by Titanium Software. Using this app is safer than manually deleting the files, which is likely to cause a whole host of issues.

To delete the Revisions folder with OnyX, please follow these steps:


  Launch OnyX, enter your machineâs password and confirm the disk verification.
  Click the Cleaning tab then select the Misc. pane.
  Select the Automatically saved versions of the documents checkbox, and deselect the other checkboxes that are enabled by default.
  Click the Execute button to clear the revisions folder.


â ï¸ Warning: these steps will not only delete Versions of Sketch files, but also documents created by any other apps that use Auto Save.

To stop Sketch saving backups and versions to this location, you can deselect the Auto Save checkbox in the Mac appâs preferences, which can be found under the General tab.

We do not recommended that you disable Auto Save so you donât accidentally lose any work. However this will be sure to stop your disk space from bloating undesirably.",
